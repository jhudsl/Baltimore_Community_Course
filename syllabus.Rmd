**Class Website:**  https://jhudatascience.org/Baltimore_Community_Course 

**CoursePlus:** coming

**Zoom link will be emailed to students.**

**Dates:** 

The course will meet during 3rd and 4th quarters (2 credits each quarter).
Students who take the class need to commit to both quarters (for continuity of the projects they will work on).

**Time:** 1:30-3 PM EST on Zoom

Students will meet in class (virtually) once per week (1:30-3 PM EST on Zoom).

Students will work in groups outside of class on community-based projects. 

**Instructors:** 

* Carrie Wright (cwrigh60@jhu.edu),
* Ava Hoffman (ava.hoffman@jhu.edu), and 
* Michael Rosenblum (mrosen@jhu.edu)


**Communication will mainly occur through Slack and we will email you about how to connect to slack.**


**Requirements**

Students are required to have prior experience with R programming and need to have taken the following data science courses (or have equivalent experience): 
140.711 Advanced Data Science I and 140.712 Advanced Data Science II
Instructor permission is required to enroll in the course. 



## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to:

1) Describe the history of Johns Hopkins and the biostatistics department in the Baltimore community.  Evaluate and discuss how this **historical context** and the **current context** influences our interactions with community members.
2) **Critically reflect** on their own service-learning project work and how their role as a statistician impacts the organization, as well as the greater context of society and social structures (not just the course project).
3) Articulate what **critical service learning** is and describe how it differs from traditional community service endeavors. Evaluate and discuss how other methods can cause harm to communities.
4) Understand more about how to successfully **navigate challenges** that occur when applying data cleaning, wrangling, analysis, collection planning, visualization, and communication skills to problems in **non-academic settings**, as the students **create** (with the guidance and help of the community organization) **data science products** for the goals of the assigned organization project. 
5) Work with others to **create an implementation plan** for the data science products that is viable and useful for the respective community organization members. Work with stakeholders at a high level to understand their needs as well as the limitations of the data.
6) Use teaching methods to **teach others** from various backgrounds and experiences  to use data science techniques to work with data and communicate effectively about data. 
7) Plan for community organizations to continue to work with data science products in a **sustainable way** even after projects are over.

**How often will students and organizations meet?**
This depends on the project goals, but approximately 30 min - 1 hr every 2 weeks for the duration of the term. (Feb - mid May - 3rd and 4th term). Meetings will also be supplemented by emails. Keep in mind that organizations are busy and staff may not be getting paid for their work.
