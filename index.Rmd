Class sessions will be `r config::get("course_time")`.


### **Main Goal**

This course is focused on helping students learn how to apply their data science knowledge in non-academic settings. Students will **reflect on their role** as a statistician in society. They will learn more about being **mindful and ethical** practitioners of data science techniques **to advocate for social change**. Students will partner with community-based organizations (CBOs) in Baltimore to work on a data science related goal.

Students will focus on developing:

- critical service-learning skills
- data science skills
- professional skills

Students will work in teams with a CBO to:

- develop **data science products** (such as a dashboard, data analysis, series of visualizations, etc.)
- develop **training material** for CBO users to use and implement the products
- develop **sustainability / maintenance plans** for CBOs to continue with the data science product in the future and how they can continue to use more data science methods more generally 

CBOs include those that work with youths, work for resource equity, and more.
