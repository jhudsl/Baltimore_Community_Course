### **Main Goal**

Students will work in teams with a CBO to:

- develop **data science products** (such as a dashboard, data analysis, series of visualizations, etc.)

- develop **training material** for CBO users to use and implement the products

- develop **sustainability / maintenance plans** for CBOs to continue with the data science product

Students will focus on developing:

- data science skills
- professional skills
- critical service learning skills

Students will **reflect on their role** as a statistician in society.

They will learn more about being **mindful and ethical** practitioners of data science techniques **to advocate for social change**.
