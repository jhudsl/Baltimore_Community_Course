<br>
 
### **Logistics**

- **Zoom** will be used for classes.
- **Slack** will be used for communication.

### **Course Goals**

In this course, students partner with [community-based organizations (CBOs)](https://source.jhu.edu/about/partner-organizations) in Baltimore to work on a data science related goal. CBOs work with youths, advocate for resource equity, and meet other needs within their communities. Students will:

- Apply their data science knowledge in non-academic settings
- **Reflect on their role** as a statistician in society
- Learn more about being **mindful and ethical** practitioners of data science techniques **to advocate for social change**
- Develop critical service-learning, data science, and professional skills
- Develop **data science product(s)** (such as a dashboard, data analysis, series of visualizations, etc.)
- Develop **training material** to help CBOs use and implement the product(s)
- Develop **sustainability / maintenance plans** for CBOs to continue using the product(s) long-term
