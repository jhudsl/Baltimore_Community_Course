For this assignment we would like you to visit the [Shiny Gallary](https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/) to familiarize yourself with what is possible with Shiny and how people have used it.  Please be sure to scroll to the bottom of the Gallary!

**Slack Questions:**

On Slack for this weeks channel write about:

1) Which app did you find most inspiring and why?
2) Find an app that used Shiny in a more unusual or unconventional way. What could you possibly learn from this? 
3) What limitations or barriers do you think our teams might encounter if we try to make or use a Shiny app for our projects?
