Please research the CBO you were assigned and respond to these questions in your journal. 
 


1) What is the mission for the CBO?


2) How old is the CBO?


3) Do you think the CBO is large (many employees) or small (few employees)?



4) What kind of background/experiences do you think the CBOâ€™s employees have?



5) What problem(s) do(es) the CBO address? How?



6) What is your impression of  the root cause of these problems? (remember that the CBO members have a great wealth of knowledge about these issues)



7) What from your first impression could potentially be helpful to the CBO? (remember to let the CBO guide the project direction, but balance this with contributing your input/experience particularly when it comes to data science - one way to do this is to ask open ended questions and let them explain before you make suggestions)
