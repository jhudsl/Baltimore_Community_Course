# Projects

Students will work in groups of 3-5 on projects with a community based organization (CBO). Students will work with the CBO to identify the **main priority project goals**, as well as to identify other goals would be of interest but are not the priority. Students should keep an open dialog with the CBO about what they think might possible for these additional goals, while being mindful about not over promising. 

Student groups should focus on the development of these main priorities and **seek feedback from the CBO** about if the project is meeting the intended goals. 

The projects are intended to **scale** based on the time and capacity available to the students working on the projects. If the main goals of the project are met, students can then work on additional project goals. 

Things to remember: 

- As this is an extra difficult time for everyone due to the pressures of the pandemic, **try to practice patience** with the CBO members and your fellow project members. Remember that the CBO members have other priorities and may not be able to get back to you as quickly as you might expect. 

- Some of the CBO members may be new to data science and so **there will be a learning period** for you to explain what data products are possible. This may cause the **main project goals to evolve over time**. 

- Remember that **you are learning** about what the CBO does and about their goals. This may also cause the definition of the main project goals to evolve over time.

- **We will have misunderstandings** with each other and the CBO members. This is expected and part of the process. Try to **stay open to adapting** as we clarify our communications with one another.
