## Notes about PRs

There are GitHub actions that will take a few seconds to start that test if there are broken URLs and check the spelling (and code styling). Waiting a bit before merging will allow these to show up.

If there are spelling "errors" that are intentional, please modify the dictionary.text file in the resources directory. 

## Assignments

- to add an assignment without a quiz: copy one of the existing Assignments/*.Rmd files and save in this directory. Update the link on the Schedule.Rmd with the assignment html link.

- to add a quiz assignment: copy one of the existing Assignments/Quiz_Assignments to a new Rmd in this directory and modify for your questions. Publish this on the JHU shiny account. Update the link on the Schedule.Rmd with the shiny link.

Note: Carrie can publish the shiny app to the JHU account if you do not have access (and she will also update the schedule).
